The ParkingLot class should be responsible for holding the spots or occupiedSpots. This is because the ParkingLot is the main entity that physically contains the parking spots.

The NearEntranceStrategy class should indeed use a heap data structure to keep track of the nearest available spots to the entrance. However, it should not recalculate the heap every time a getTicket request is made. This would be inefficient and could slow down the system, especially if the parking lot is large.

Instead, the NearEntranceStrategy class should maintain the heap as a state. When the strategy is initialized, it should build the heap using the available spots provided by the ParkingLot class. Then, whenever a spot is allocated or freed, the strategy should update the heap accordingly. This way, the heap always reflects the current state of the parking lot, and finding the nearest available spot is a quick operation.

So, in essence, the ParkingLot class should notify the NearEntranceStrategy class whenever a spot is allocated or freed. The strategy class should then update its heap and return the updated spot to the ParkingLot class. This approach ensures that the heap is always up-to-date and that the nearest spot can be found quickly when a getTicket request is made.

When a vehicle arrives and a ticket is requested, the ParkingLot class would use the set strategy to determine which spot to allocate. The strategy would take into consideration the current state of the parking lot (i.e., which spots are available) and the specific requirements of the vehicle (e.g., if it’s a car, it needs a compact or large spot; if it’s a motorcycle, it needs a motorcycle spot).

Once the strategy has determined the most suitable spot, this information can be passed back to the ParkingLot class, which would then update the state of the parking lot (marking the spot as occupied) and issue the ticket with the allocated spot information.

The main entry point for the user (or in this case, the vehicle) would be the Entrance class. The Entrance class would interact with the ParkingLot class to issue a ticket and allocate a parking spot when a vehicle arrives.

Here’s a possible flow of logic:

A vehicle arrives at the entrance and requests a ticket.
The Entrance class receives this request and communicates with the ParkingLot class to handle it.
The ParkingLot class uses the current parking strategy (NearEntranceStrategy in your example) to determine the optimal spot for the vehicle. This is where the logic to get the optimal spot from the strategy resides.
The ParkingLot class updates its state to mark the chosen spot as occupied.
The ParkingLot class creates a new ParkingTicket with the necessary details (like the spot number, entrance time, etc.) and returns it to the Entrance class.
The Entrance class gives the ticket to the vehicle.


the Entrance class will have a reference to the ParkingLot class. This is because the Entrance needs to interact with the ParkingLot to issue tickets and allocate parking spots.

When a vehicle arrives and requests a ticket from the Entrance, the Entrance class will communicate this request to the ParkingLot class. The ParkingLot class will then create a new ParkingTicket instance, populate it with the necessary details (like the allocated spot and the entrance time), and return this ticket to the Entrance class. The Entrance class will then give this ticket to the vehicle.

Even though the ParkingLot class creates the ParkingTicket instance, it doesn’t need to keep a permanent reference to it. Once the ticket is created and returned, the ParkingLot class’s job is done. It updates its state to reflect the new parking session (i.e., marks the allocated spot as occupied), but it doesn’t need to keep track of the ticket itself.

When the ParkingLot instance is created, it will also create the instances of Entrance, Exit, DisplayBoard, and Payment. When creating the Entrance instances, it will pass a reference to itself (the ParkingLot instance) to them. This way, each Entrance has a reference to the ParkingLot and can interact with it when a vehicle arrives.

When a vehicle arrives at an Entrance and requests a ticket, the Entrance will use its reference to the ParkingLot to handle this request. The ParkingLot will use the current parking strategy to find an optimal spot, create a new ParkingTicket with the necessary details, update its state to mark the spot as occupied, and then return the ticket to the Entrance. The Entrance will then give this ticket to the vehicle.

When initializing the ParkingLot, you would create all the parking spots and assign them to their respective sections. You would also create the Entrance and Exit instances and associate them with their respective sections.

As for the parking strategy, it would still be set at the ParkingLot level. However, when a vehicle arrives at a particular entrance, the strategy would take into account only the spots in the section associated with that entrance. This could be achieved by passing the relevant section information to the strategy when determining the optimal spot.

So, in essence, while there might be different sets of spots for each entrance/exit pair, they are all managed by the same ParkingLot instance and the same parking strategy. The strategy simply adjusts its logic based on the current entrance/exit pair.

If each entrance serves a different section of the parking lot and you’re using a strategy like NearEntranceStrategy, you would need a separate heap for each section to quickly find the nearest available spot.

These heaps would be maintained by the strategy class. When a vehicle arrives at a particular entrance, the strategy would use the corresponding heap to find the nearest available spot in that section.
